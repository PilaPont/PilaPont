## About me!

I worked in mechanical engineering and commercial management for about eleven years until I experienced Odoo framework as a user and I became interested in the coding world. It was strange to those around me why after many years of working in different fields, I decided to change my job. But that's exactly the point! I wanted a new different story in my career which I could enjoy it and here I am.

I started coding in django framework and for a year, I did some projects for myself and the company that I worked for. such as:

#### - [TelegramBot](https://github.com/PilaPont/TelegramBot)

#### - [RestaurantsApp](https://github.com/PilaPont/RestaurantsApp)

#### - [PollsApp](https://github.com/PilaPont/PollsApp)

#### - [BlogAPI](https://github.com/PilaPont/blog)

After one year and because of my previous images of Odoo framework (which introduced me to the world of coding :)), I decided to go on with Odoo. Since then I am continuously coding in Odoo.

Since 2021, I have teaching Odoo in a company beside of coding. You know? I like teaching, so that's the more lovely part of story.
